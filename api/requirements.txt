# Vercel API Dependencies
# These packages are available in the Vercel Python runtime
#
# Note: DeepFace and its ML dependencies are NOT included here
# because they require model files and significant compute resources.
# For full emotion recognition, deploy the backend separately.
#
# Core dependencies for basic API functionality are minimal
# as Vercel's Python runtime includes standard library packages.
